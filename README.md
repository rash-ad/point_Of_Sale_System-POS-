This project is a Clothing Store Point of Sale (POS) System created for my course project. The purpose of this system is to help a clothing shop manage its daily activities such as billing, product management, customer management, and sales reports. The system allows the cashier to add items to the bill, calculate the total price automatically, apply discounts, and print a receipt. It also includes features for managing clothing items by adding product details such as name, size, color, category, and price, while updating the inventory after each sale. The POS system can store customer details and keep track of their purchase history. It also provides useful sales reports like daily and monthly totals to help understand business performance. The project is built using standard web technologies and a database to store product and sales information. Overall, this Clothing POS System is designed to make store operations easier, faster, and more organized, fulfilling the requirements of a complete and functional course project.
